To do:
1) Clean up and refactor the code. (Make it organized, and have short files that each do their thing, and only that.)
    a) Make subprograms
        i) in seperate files
    b) Minimize global variables
    c) Make a seperate test program without all the other junk
    d) Document the programs carefully
    e) Test them
    f) Make debug code
        i) Use Serial3
        ii) Make a triangle or sine wave subprogram at 100 kHz sample rate
    g) Use Github Copilot to help organize this and speed things up (Get Ray up on it or do it yourself)
    h) Use variable names that are descriptive, match the documentation and go with that seperate block of code.
    i) Try to make the code simple, but not use too much time.
2) Learn how to operate the transmitter so two are not needed for testing (Rob)
3) Try 250 Ohm screen resistor
4) Minimize RFI possibility (No uneeded cables should be connected)
    a) Don't connect Ethernet until needed
        i) Perhaps use shorter cables or optical link.
    b) Don't connect the computer that is connected to the transmitter to power (run on batteries)
    c) Minimize the loop area for any ground loops
    d) Look for RFI with the scope
    e) Perhaps use ferrite beads if we find RFI somewhere and need to have the cable connected
